# Installing docker

## Linux

- ### Ubuntu
#### From Repository
##### 1. Setup Repository
1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```
2. Add Docker’s official GPG key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
3. Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.

> Note: The `lsb_release -cs` sub-command below returns the name of your Ubuntu distribution, such as xenial. Sometimes, in a distribution like Linux Mint, you might need to change `$(lsb_release -cs)` to your parent Ubuntu distribution. For example, if you are using Linux Mint Tessa, you could use bionic. Docker does not offer any guarantees on untested and unsupported Ubuntu distributions.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
